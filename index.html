      &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
      strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them
      better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose
      face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who
      errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without
      error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who
      knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a
      worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
      achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while
      daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid
      souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;
